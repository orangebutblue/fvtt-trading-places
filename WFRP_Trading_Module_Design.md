- Complete implementation of *Death on the Reik Companion* pages 71-78
- All probability mechanics, restrictions, and market dynamics
- No "arcade mode" or simplified alternatives

### Core Functional Domains
1. **Cargo Availability Checking**
   - Probabilistic availability: `(Size + Wealth) × 10%` chance on 1d100
   - Dynamic cargo size: `(Size + Wealth) × (1d100 rounded to nearest 10)` EP
   - Settlement-specific production lists
   - Special "Trade" settlement mechanics

2. **Purchase Price Calculation**
   - Seasonal base price variations
   - +10% penalty for partial cargo purchases
   - Haggle test mechanics (±10%/20% price adjustments)
   - Wine/brandy quality tier pricing

3. **Sale Price Calculation**
   - Location/time restrictions (can't sell where bought OR wait 1 week)
   - Buyer availability: `Size × 10 (+30 if Trade)%` chance on 1d100
   - Wealth-based price modifiers (exact official percentages)
   - Village restrictions (Hamlets: Grain only, except Spring = 1d10 EP other goods)
   - Desperate sale options (50% base price at Trade settlements)
   - Rumor system (Gossip tests for 2× base price locations)

4. **Market Demand Determination**
   - Dynamic demand based on settlement characteristics
   - Seasonal demand variations
   - Supply/demand interaction effects

5. **Haggling Mechanics**
   - Opposing skill test system
   - Dealmaker talent bonuses
   - Settlement-specific merchant skill levels

6. **Settlement Lookup/Filtering**
   - Region-based organization
   - Size/wealth filtering capabilities
   - Production category searches

## Algorithm Specifications

### I. Buying Algorithm (Cargo Availability)

This process determines if cargo is available in a settlement, what type, what quantity, and at what price.

#### Step 0: Settlement Information Lookup
For the selected settlement, retrieve from dataset:
1. **Size Rating** (CS/C/T/ST/V/F/M) - converts to numeric 1-4 for calculations
2. **Wealth Rating** (1-5) 
3. **Produces List** (array of cargo categories)

#### Step 1: Availability Check
1. **Calculate Base Chance**: Add Size Rating + Wealth Rating, multiply by 10 to get percentage
2. **Roll Check**: Roll 1d100
   - If result ≤ calculated chance: cargo is available
   - If result > calculated chance: no cargo available

#### Step 2A: Cargo Type Determination
1. **Specific Goods**: If settlement produces specific cargo types, these are available
2. **Trade Settlements**: If settlement produces "Trade", roll on random cargo table (seasonal)
3. **Multiple Productions**: If settlement produces both specific goods AND "Trade", both types may be available
4. **Special Case - Trade Centers**: Settlements with "Trade" + other goods can have TWO available cargoes

#### Step 2B: Cargo Size Calculation (Encumbrance Points)
1. **Base Value**: Add Size Rating + Wealth Rating
2. **Multiplier**: Roll 1d100, round UP to nearest 10 (e.g., 36 becomes 40)
3. **Total Size**: Base Value × Multiplier = Available Encumbrance Points
4. **Trade Center Bonus**: If wealth comes from "Trade", roll 1d100 twice, use the higher multiplier

#### Step 3: Price Negotiation
1. **Base Price**: Look up cargo price from Base Price Table (factor in season, wine quality if applicable)
2. **Partial Purchase Penalty**: If not buying full available cargo, increase price by 10%
3. **Haggle Test**: Player can attempt comparative Haggle test vs merchant (typically 32-52 skill)
4. **Final Price**: 
   - Haggle success: -10% price (or -20% with Dealmaker talent)
   - Haggle failure: base price (or +10% at GM discretion)

### II. Selling Algorithm

This process determines if buyers exist, what they'll pay, and finalizes the transaction.

#### Step 1: Sale Eligibility Check
1. **Location Restriction**: Cannot sell cargo in the same settlement where it was purchased
2. **Time Alternative**: OR must wait minimum 1 week before attempting sale in same location
3. **Validation**: Check that current location ≠ purchase location OR sufficient time has passed

#### Step 2: Buyer Availability Check
1. **Calculate Chance**:
   - Base: Settlement Size Rating × 10
   - Bonus: +30 if settlement produces "Trade"
2. **Roll Check**: Roll 1d100
   - If result ≤ calculated chance: buyer found
   - If result > calculated chance: no buyer available
3. **Partial Sale Option**: If no buyer, can attempt to sell only HALF the cargo and re-roll
4. **Village Restrictions**: 
   - Size 1 settlements (Villages): normally no demand except Grain in Spring
   - Maximum 1d10 Encumbrance Points of non-Grain goods can be sold

#### Step 3: Offer Price Determination
1. **Base Price**: Use Base Price Table for the cargo type and current season
2. **Wealth Adjustment**: Multiply base price by settlement wealth modifier:
   - Squalid (1): 50% of base price
   - Poor (2): 80% of base price  
   - Average (3): 100% of base price (no change)
   - Bustling (4): 105% of base price
   - Prosperous (5): 110% of base price

#### Step 4: Haggling and Transaction
1. **Haggle Test**: Player can attempt comparative Haggle test against buyer
2. **Price Adjustment**: 
   - Success: +10% to offer price (or +20% with Dealmaker talent)
   - Failure: offer price stands
3. **Transaction Completion**: If price accepted, sale is finalized

### Optional Sale Methods

#### Desperate Sale
- **Availability**: Any settlement that produces "Trade"
- **Price**: 50% of base price (no wealth modifiers)
- **No Haggling**: Price is fixed
- **Use Case**: Quick disposal of unwanted cargo

#### Rumor-Based Premium Sales
1. **Information Gathering**: Difficult (-10) Gossip Test
2. **Rumor Discovery**: Learn of settlement with high demand for specific cargo
3. **Premium Price**: Can sell for 200% of base price at rumored location
4. **Risk**: Rumors may be false or outdated

## Data Layer Design

### Settlement Data Structure
**9 Core Fields:**
```json
{
  "region": "Reikland",
  "name": "ALTDORF",
  "size": "CS",
  "ruler": "Emperor Karl-Franz I Holswig-Schliestein",
  "population": 105000,
  "wealth": 5,
  "source": ["Trade", "Government"],
  "garrison": ["500a/8000c"],
  "notes": "Imperial Capital, Great Cathedral of Sigmar, University of Altdorf, Schools of Wizardry"
}
```

### Cargo Data Structure
**Comprehensive cargo definitions with seasonal pricing:**
```json
{
  "cargoTypes": [
    {
      "name": "Grain",
      "category": "Bulk Goods",
      "description": "A collective term for all kinds of agricultural products...",
      "basePrices": {
        "spring": 1,
        "summer": 0.5,
        "autumn": 0.25,
        "winter": 0.5
      },
      "encumbrancePerUnit": 10,
      "encumbranceNote": "Prices are per 10 Encumbrance Points (EP)."
    },
    {
      "name": "Wine/Brandy",
      "category": "Luxury Goods",

        { "roll": 1, "tierName": "Swill", "price": 0.5 },
        { "roll": [2, 3], "tierName": "Passable", "price": 1 },
        { "roll": [4, 5], "tierName": "Average", "price": 1.5 },
        { "roll": [6, 7], "tierName": "Good", "price": 3 },
        { "roll": [8, 9], "tierName": "Excellent", "price": 6 },
        { "roll": 10, "tierName": "Top Shelf", "price": 12 }
      ],
      "encumbrancePerUnit": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Data Structure
**System integration configuration:**
```json
{
  "currency": {
    "field": "system.money.gc",
    "name": "Gold Crowns",
    "abbreviation": "GC"
  },
  "inventory": {
    "field": "items",
    "addMethod": "createEmbeddedDocuments"
  },
  "skills": {
    "haggle": "system.skills.haggle.total",
    "gossip": "system.skills.gossip.total"
  },
  "talents": {
    "dealmaker": "system.talents.dealmaker"
  },
  "systemName": "wfrp4e",
  "systemVersion": "7.0.0"
}
```

### Settlement Size Enumeration
- **CS** = City State (any size)
- **C** = City (10,000+)
- **T** = Town (1,000 - 10,000)
- **ST** = Small Town (100 - 1,000)
- **V** = Village (1-100)
- **F** = Fort (any size)
- **M** = Mine (any size)

### Wealth Scale Mapping
- **1** = Squalid (50% base price)
- **2** = Poor (80% base price)
- **3** = Average (100% base price)
- **4** = Bustling (105% base price)
- **5** = Prosperous (110% base price)

### Dynamic Category System
- **No hardcoded category lists**
- System automatically scans settlement data to build available categories
- New datasets can introduce novel production categories without code modification
- Categories discovered from `source` field across all settlements

### Data Format
**JSON** format for all data files
- Native JavaScript object compatibility
- Easy parsing in FoundryVTT environment
- Human-readable for manual editing
- Supports complex nested structures

---

## System Integration

### SystemAdapter Architecture
**Configuration-driven adapter for currency and inventory management:**
```javascript
class SystemAdapter {
    constructor(config = null) {
        this.config = config || this.getDefaultConfig();
        this.systemId = (typeof game !== 'undefined' && game?.system?.id) || 'unknown';
        this.isFoundryEnvironment = typeof game !== 'undefined';
        this.errorHandler = null;
    }
    
    // Currency operations
    async getCurrencyValue(actor) {...}
    async deductCurrency(actor, amount, reason) {...}
    async addCurrency(actor, amount, reason) {...}
    
    // Inventory operations  
    async addCargoToInventory(actor, cargoName, quantity, cargoData, purchaseInfo) {...}
    async removeCargoFromInventory(actor, itemId, quantity) {...}
    findCargoInInventory(actor, cargoName, filters) {...}
    
    // Validation
    validateActor(actor) {...}
    validateTransaction(actor, transactionType, transactionData) {...}
}
```

### Configuration-Driven Approach
**System-agnostic field mapping:**
```javascript
// In config.json
{
  "currency": {
    "field": "system.money.gc",
    "name": "Gold Crowns",
    "abbreviation": "GC"
  },
  "inventory": {
    "field": "items",
    "addMethod": "createEmbeddedDocuments",
    "deleteMethod": "deleteEmbeddedDocuments",
    "type": "loot"
  },
  "skills": {
    "haggle": "system.skills.haggle.total",
    "gossip": "system.skills.gossip.total"
  },
  "talents": {
    "dealmaker": "system.talents.dealmaker"
  }
}
```

### Actor Validation and Error Handling
**Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages:**
- Actor type validation
- Required field existence checks
- Currency and inventory accessibility validation
- Transaction pre-validation before execution
