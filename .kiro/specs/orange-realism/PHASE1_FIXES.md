# Phase 1 Foundry Harness - Critical Fixes Applied

## Overview
Based on comprehensive review feedback, several critical issues in the Phase 1 Foundry Harness have been identified and fixed. These fixes ensure the harness works correctly with real module code and provides proper failure detection.

## Critical Fixes Applied

### ✅ 1. Fixed Settings Storage Infinite Recursion
**Problem**: `game.settings.get` and `game.settings.set` were calling themselves recursively.
**Solution**: Added proper backing storage with `game.settingsStorage` Map.

**Before:**
```javascript
globalThis.game.settings.get = (module, key) => {
    const settingKey = `${module}.${key}`;
    return globalThis.game.settings.get(settingKey) || null; // RECURSIVE!
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
globalThis.game.settingsStorage = new Map();
globalThis.game.settings.get = (module, key) => {
    const settingKey = `${module}.${key}`;
    return globalThis.game.settingsStorage.get(settingKey) || null;
};
```

### ✅ 2. Improved Module Load Failure Detection
**Problem**: Import errors were silently masked as "expected during development."
**Solution**: Added `HARNESS_ALLOW_MODULE_FAILURE` flag and strict mode detection.

**New Behavior:**
- **Development Mode**: `HARNESS_ALLOW_MODULE_FAILURE=1` allows silent failures
- **Strict Mode**: Module load failures throw errors when file exists
- **Future Integration**: Can require real module with `HARNESS_EXPECT_REAL_MODULE=1`

### ✅ 3. Added Scenario Transition Planning
**Problem**: Scenarios would always pass with mocks, hiding real integration failures.
**Solution**: Added environment-based transition controls and failure modes.

**New Features:**
- Scenarios can detect when real APIs should exist
- Warning messages for upcoming transition requirements
- Configurable failure modes for different development phases

### ✅ 4. Fixed Non-Deterministic Randomness
**Problem**: Scenarios used `Math.random()` making CI results inconsistent.
**Solution**: Created seeded random helper using dice stub's RNG.

**New Utilities:**
- `random()` - Seeded 0-1 random
- `randomInt(min, max)` - Seeded integer range
- `randomVariance(base, variance)` - Random with deviation
- `percentRoll(target)` - Foundry-style percentage rolls

### ✅ 5. Fatal Scenario Load Failures
**Problem**: Syntax errors in scenarios were silently skipped.
**Solution**: Scenario load failures now cause run failures and are tracked.

**New Behavior:**
- Load failures are recorded as failed scenarios
- Zero successful scenarios cause run failure
- CI properly detects scenario problems

## Environment Variables

### Current Phase (Development)
```bash
# Allow module failures (current default)
HARNESS_ALLOW_MODULE_FAILURE=1 npm run harness

# Require module to exist and load
npm run harness:strict
```

### Future Phase (Integration)
```bash
# Expect real module integration
HARNESS_EXPECT_REAL_MODULE=1 npm run harness:real
```

### Testing
```bash
# Deterministic CI runs
HARNESS_SEED=42 npm run harness:ci
```

## NPM Scripts Updated

- `npm run harness` - Development mode (allows module failures)
- `npm run harness:strict` - Strict mode (requires module if present)
- `npm run harness:real` - Integration mode (expects real module)
- `npm run harness:ci` - CI mode (deterministic with seed)

## Scenario Updates

### buying-flow.js
- Added real module integration detection
- Added DataManager API testing when available
- Added template rendering failure modes
- Transition warnings for Phase 3 requirements

### availability-only.js
- Replaced `Math.random()` with seeded helpers
- Deterministic merchant generation
- Consistent availability rolls

### orange-realism-schema.js
- Uses seeded randomness throughout
- Tests new DataManager methods
- Validates schema compliance

## Testing Results

### ✅ Deterministic Behavior
```bash
$ npm run harness:ci
# Always produces same results with HARNESS_SEED=42
```

### ✅ Load Failure Detection
```bash
$ npm run harness broken-scenario.js
# Now properly fails instead of silently skipping
```

### ✅ Module Integration Ready
```bash
$ npm run harness:real
# Will test real module when main.js exists
```

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1-2 (Current)
- Use `npm run harness` for normal development
- Scenarios run in mock mode with warnings
- CI uses `harness:ci` for deterministic results

### Phase 3+ (Module Integration)
- Use `npm run harness:real` to test real module
- Scenarios will require DataManager integration
- Template rendering becomes mandatory

### Debugging
- Use `npm run harness:strict` to catch hidden issues
- Load failures are immediately visible
- Settings storage prevents crashes

## Quality Improvements

1. **Reliability**: Fixed infinite recursion crash
2. **Determinism**: Seeded randomness for consistent CI
3. **Failure Detection**: Proper error reporting and exit codes
4. **Future-Ready**: Transition controls for real module integration
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and warnings

These fixes ensure the Foundry Harness provides a solid foundation for testing throughout all development phases, from initial mock-based development through full module integration.
