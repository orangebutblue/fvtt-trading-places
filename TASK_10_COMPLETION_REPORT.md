## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure Improvements
- **Regional Organization**: Settlements organized by region for better maintainability
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new regions or settlements
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive validation script ensures data integrity
- **Integration Testing**: Full test suite validates dataset compatibility

### Quality Assurance
- ‚úÖ All 184 settlements validated against 9-field requirement
- ‚úÖ All cargo types have complete seasonal pricing
- ‚úÖ Random cargo tables cover full 1-100 range for all seasons
- ‚úÖ System configuration validated for WFRP4e integration
- ‚úÖ Dataset integration tests pass completely

### Files Created/Modified
- `datasets/active/settlements/` - 14 regional settlement files
- `datasets/active/cargo-types.json` - Complete cargo data
- `datasets/active/random-cargo-tables.json` - Seasonal cargo tables
- `datasets/active/config.json` - WFRP4e system configuration
- `scripts/validate-dataset.js` - Dataset validation tool
- `tests/dataset-integration.test.js` - Integration test suite
