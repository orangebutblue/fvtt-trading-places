That is an astute observation. While the core **Trading Rules** define seven major categories of bulk goods for setting the **Base Price**, the sources indicate the existence of numerous specific goods that fall within these broader categories, or are considered specialized cargo, herbs, or contraband.

The initial list focused on the seven categories used for bulk pricing per **10 Encumbrance points (EP)**, which are: **Grain, Armaments, Luxuries, Metal, Timber, Wine/Brandy, and Wool**.

However, the sources mention many specific items within these and other specialized groups, suggesting a much wider range of actual cargo types:

## I. Specific Cargo Types and Their Categories

### Bulk Trade Categories (Priced per 10 EP)

These are the formalized categories used in the trading rules, with examples of specific goods that fall under them:

| Category | Specific Examples of Goods | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grain** | General agricultural products, barley, wheat, legumes, root vegetables, dried meats, fish. | |
| **Armaments** | Refined weapons and armour suitable for arming a militia or standing army, hand weapons, leather armour, bolts. More exotic items like cannon and blackpowder are hauled by specialised barges. | |
| **Luxuries** | **Textiles, pottery, glass, bricks**, genuine imported luxuries (spices, silks), Mithril, or **Bugman’s infamous XXXXXX ale**. | |
| **Metal** | Valuable **ore** or processed **ingots** of purified copper, iron, steel, or other useful materials. | |
| **Timber** | Building materials drawn from the great forests of the Empire. | |
| **Wine/Brandy**| Various qualities of wine and brandy, which have highly variable prices. | |
| **Wool** | The prime component of clothing across the Empire. Containers include **sacks** (3 EP per sack). | |

### Specialized and Contraband Cargo

These items often involve non-standard handling, specific containers, or are priced based on individual value rather than bulk EP trade rates:

| Item Type | Notes on Usage, Encumbrance (EP), or Trade Context | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bretonnian brandy** | Common contraband, illegally imported due to the Emperor's edict. | |
| **Magical Supplies** | Often illegal and moved by smugglers. | |
| **Sleeping Passengers** | Smuggler term for **dead bodies**, used by physicians and necromancers. | |
| **Warpstone dust** | Powdered warpstone, found in vials; highly illegal and dangerous. | |
| **Perfumés** | Etelka Herzen's travelling case contains dozens of vials of perfume. | |
| **Books/Grimoires** | Found in libraries, often covering arcane or forbidden Lores of magic. | |
| **Honey** | Recoverable from beehives at Castle Wittgenstein; consuming it may grant temporary benefits or Minor Exposure to Corruption due to warpstone effects. | |
| **Assorted Herbs**| Over 20 specific named herbs (e.g., Agurk, Valerian, Gesundheit), which typically have **0 Encumbrance** and are gathered via Foraging. | |

## II. EP, Sacks, and Other Containers

You asked about the relationship between EP and containers like sacks, and specifically about ale/kegs.

### Standardized Containers (Known EP Values)

*   **Sack of Wool:** A specific example shows that a sack of wool is equivalent to **3 Encumbrance Points**. This indicates that standardized EP conversion exists for common bulk containers.
*   **Prepared Herbs:** Herbs like Agurk or Valerian, once prepared, are noted as having **0 Encumbrance**.

### Bulk Measurement and Alcohol

*   **Bulk Cargo:** The sources confirm that **bulk goods** like timber and metals are preferably transported by river. Furthermore, trade goods are generally not sold in quantities less than **10 EP**.
*   **Lifts:** In Kemperbad, lifts charge fees based on bulk cargo equivalent to **30 encumbrance**, reinforcing the use of EP as a generalized bulk measurement.
*   **Kegs of Ale/Brandy:** Although "Bugman’s infamous XXXXXX ale" is specifically listed under Luxuries, and brandy is discussed, the sources **do not provide a specific EP conversion rate** for a standard keg of ale, wine, or brandy. In-game, the *Carries* capacity of a vessel determines how much total EP it can handle.

## III. Encumbrance and Vessel Capacity (Weight vs. Space)

To clarify the effect of modifications like weapons or engines on a boat:

1.  **Vehicle Encumbrance (Weight Added):** Components like engines, armour, and weapons increase the vessel's fixed weight, measured in **Encumbrance points**.
    *   Example: A Steam Engine adds **200 Encumbrance points**. A Ram adds between 30 and **120 Encumbrance points** depending on the vessel size.
2.  **Carries Capacity (Cargo Space Lost):** A boat's *Carries* capacity measures its ability to haul additional cargo.
3.  **The Rule:** The sources explicitly state: **"for every added point of Vehicle Encumbrance lose a point of Carries"**.

Therefore, heavy items increase the boat's own weight (**Encumbrance**) at the direct expense of the amount of profit-making cargo it can transport (**Carries capacity**). For example, installing a Steam Engine takes up a substantial amount of space that would otherwise be dedicated to cargo, consuming "about half of a boat’s carrying capacity".
