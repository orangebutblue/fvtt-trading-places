The calculation of a price for a trade, whether buying or selling, is based on the quantity of goods measured in Encumbrance points (EP), the base price of the commodity, and the wealth of the trading settlement.

Here is the formula, broken down into the steps for calculating the Base Price (Buying) and the subsequent Selling Price:

## I. Calculating the Base Price (Buying)

The base price is quoted in Gold Crowns (GCs) per **10 Encumbrance points** (EP) of cargo.

**Step 1: Determine Cargo Type and Size (EP)**

1.  **Cargo Type:** Identify the commodity (Grain, Armaments, Luxuries, Metal, Timber, Wine/Brandy, or Wool).
2.  **Size (EP):** Determine the available cargo size in Encumbrance points:
    *   Formula: `(Settlement Size Rating + Settlement Wealth Rating) * (1d100 rounded up to nearest 10)`.
    *   *Note: If the settlement is a Trading Centre, the d100 result is reversed before rounding, and the larger result is used*.

**Step 2: Find the Base Price (GC/10 EP)**

1.  Consult the Base Price Table (determined by cargo type and season) to find the price in GCs per 10 EP.

**Step 3: Calculate Total Base Price (GC)**

1.  Calculate the total price for the entire cargo **before modifiers**: `(Total Cargo EP / 10) * Base Price (GC/10 EP)`.

**Step 4: Apply Modifiers (Buying)**

1.  **Metalworking Bonus:** If the cargo is **Armaments** or **Metal**, and the settlement lists **Metalworking** in its production, **add 10%** to the sale price.
2.  **Wine/Brandy Quality:** If the cargo is **Wine or Brandy**, the price per cargo unit is determined by rolling on the Quality table (ranging from 0.5 GC to 12 GC) instead of the standard Base Price table.
3.  **Partial Purchase Surcharge:** If the Characters buy less than the entire available cargo, **add 10%** to the base price per 10 EP.

**Step 5: Haggle (Buying)**

1.  Make an opposed **Haggle Test** with the vendor. A successful test raises or lowers the price by **10%** (or **20%** if the Character has the Dealmaker Talent).

## II. Calculating the Selling Price

When selling a cargo, the base price from Step 3 above is modified by the wealth of the buying settlement.

**Step 1: Find a Buyer**

1.  Calculate the chance of finding a buyer: `(Settlement Size Rating * 10) + (+30 if Trade is listed in Produces column)`.
2.  *Note: Villages usually have no demand, except for Grain in spring*.
3.  *Note: Top Shelf Wine and Brandy will always find a buyer for at least 1d10 EP worth*.

**Step 2: Determine Offer Price (GC)**

1.  Determine the **Offer Price** by applying the Settlementâ€™s Wealth Rating to the initial Base Price:
    *   Squalid: **50% of the base price**
    *   Poor: **Base price minus 20%**
    *   Average: **Base price**
    *   Bustling: **Base price plus 5%**
    *   Prosperous: **Base price plus 10%**

**Step 3: Haggle (Selling)**

1.  Make an opposed **Haggle Test** against the buyer to increase the Offer Price (by 10% or 20% with Dealmaker Talent).

*A Character following a trade rumour may sell the appropriate good for **twice the base price**.*
*If a cargo must be sold quickly, it can always be sold at a settlement listing 'Trade' for **half of its base price**.*
