Encumbrance Points (EP) are the fundamental unit for measuring cargo bulk and weight, which directly impacts trade and river vessel management.

Here is a list and table detailing the types of cargo, their categories, pricing structure, and known container details, as drawn from the sources.

## I. Standard Trade Cargo Categories and Pricing

The general categories of trade goods are priced per **10 Encumbrance points** (EP). The size of any available cargo is calculated in Encumbrance points. Merchants typically will not sell quantities less than 10 EP.

| Cargo Type | Category/Description | Price Unit | Base Price Range (GC/10 EP) | Price Modifiers/Notes | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Grain** | General agricultural products (barley, wheat, legumes, dried meats, fish) | 10 EP | **0.25 to 1.0** | Lowest price during harvest (Autumn, 0.25 GC) and highest in Spring (1 GC). | |
| **Armaments** | Refined weapons and armour (hand weapons, leather armour, bolts) | 10 EP | **8 to 12** | Highest price in Spring (12 GC) due to campaigning season. Price increases by **10%** if the settlement lists Metalworking in production. | |
| **Luxuries** | Catchall for textiles, pottery, glass, spices, silks, Mithril, or Bugman’s XXXXXX ale | 10 EP | **50** | Price is stable year-round. | |
| **Metal** | Ore or processed ingots (copper, iron, steel) | 10 EP | **8** | Price is generally stable year-round. Price increases by **10%** if the settlement lists Metalworking in production. | |
| **Timber** | Building materials | 10 EP | **1.5 to 3.5** | Price is lowest in Summer (1.5 GC) and best in Winter (3.5 GC) and Spring, due to difficult logging conditions. | |
| **Wool** | Component for clothing | 10 EP | **1.0 to 3.0** | Price dips in Spring (1 GC) when sheep are shorn. Sacks of wool are known to be containers (see below). | |

### Special Pricing: Wine and Brandy

Wine and Brandy are a special case because their price varies widely based on quality, which is determined by a separate table, listing the price per "1 cargo" unit, not per 10 EP.

| Quality (d10 Roll) | Price per 1 Cargo | Notes | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Swill (1) | 0.5 GC | | |
| Passable (2-3) | 1 GC | | |
| Average (4-5) | 1.5 GC | | |
| Good (6-7) | 3 GC | | |
| Excellent (8-9) | 6 GC | | |
| Top Shelf (10) | 12 GC | A buyer for at least d10 EP worth of Top Shelf quality is always found in any location, even villages. | |

## II. Specific Container and Item Encumbrance

While standard pricing uses 10 EP as the base unit for calculation, a few sources give specific EP weights for individual items or containers:

| Item/Container Type | EP Value | Notes | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sack of Wool** | **3 Encumbrance Points** per sack | The abandoned river boat carries 75 such sacks. | |
| **Prepared Herbs** | **0 Encumbrance Points** | Common herbs gathered and prepared, such as Agurk, Alfunas, or Valerian. | |
| **Heavy Objects (River Debris)** | **4d10 Encumbrance Points** per object | Used to calculate the effort required to clear a dam of debris in shallow water. | |

## III. Contraband and Specialized Goods

Many specialized or illicit cargoes are mentioned, but the sources do not provide their EP value per container or price, as they are often handled on an adventure-by-adventure basis:

*   **Bretonnian brandy:** Illegal import, common contraband moved by smugglers. Smugglers may use small packets, offering 25 GC for carrying a "small amount".
*   **Warpstone dust:** Highly dangerous and illegal, stored in vials. Jean Rousseaux uses it to lace blue rotgut.
*   **Illegal magical supplies:** Moved by smugglers.
*   **Sleeping Passengers (Dead Bodies):** Transported by smugglers for necromancers or physicians.
*   **Special Cargo (Orlok Crate):** A single, large crate containing two coffins (one with a Vampire).
*   **Blucher Shipment Crate:** A small crate (roughly 2 feet on each side) marked 'Fragile' and weighing about 100 lbs. It holds various junk items (e.g., rusty scabbard, stuffed magpie, dog's skull).

## IV. Clarification on Encumbrance and Vessel Capacity

You asked why modifications like weapons or propulsion systems *increase* Encumbrance rather than capacity. This reflects the specific mechanics used for vehicles:

1.  **Encumbrance (Vehicle Weight):** When discussing modifications like weapons or plating, EP refers to *Vehicle Encumbrance*—the weight added to the boat itself. For example, a Steam Engine adds **200 Encumbrance points**.
2.  **Carries Capacity (Cargo Space):** A boat's ability to hold marketable goods is defined by its *Carries* capacity.
3.  **Inverse Relationship:** The sources explicitly state that **"for every added point of Vehicle Encumbrance lose a point of Carries"** capacity. Therefore, heavy modifications, like adding armour or a ram, make the boat heavier and reduce the amount of cargo (measured in EP) it can transport for profit.
