# Current State: Trading Places Module UI Cleanup - COMPLETED

## Problem (RESOLVED)
The previous developer implemented terrible, non-standard FoundryVTT UI patterns instead of using proper scene controls integration:
- Orange hotbar buttons with custom styling ✅ REMOVED
- Sidebar tab injection ✅ REMOVED  
- Floating button overlays ✅ REMOVED
- Macro API creation (`game.wfrpTrading`) ✅ REMOVED
- Multiple UI integration attempts with complex fallback logic ✅ CLEANED UP

## What We've Done
1. **Deleted terrible implementations:**
   - `scripts/native-ui-integration.js` (the main offender) ✅
   - `add-manual-button.js` (manual button creation) ✅
   - Test files that referenced bad UI patterns ✅

2. **Created proper scene controls:**
   - `scripts/proper-scene-controls.js` (clean implementation) ✅
   - Updated `module.json` to load the new script ✅
   - Cleaned up `scripts/main.js` to remove hotbar/sidebar nonsense ✅

3. **Fixed hook timing issue:**
   - Moved `getSceneControlButtons` hook registration to early in module initialization ✅
   - Added comprehensive debugging to track hook execution ✅

4. **FINAL CLEANUP - Removed duplicate hook registrations:**
   - Removed duplicate direct hook registration from `main.js` (lines 126-157) ✅
   - Cleaned up unnecessary debugging code in fallback function ✅
   - Now using ONLY the proper class-based approach via `WFRPProperSceneControls` ✅

## Expected Result
- A single coins icon (`fas fa-coins`) should appear in the scene controls (left sidebar)
- Clicking it should reveal a store icon (`fas fa-store`) tool  
- Clicking the store tool should open the trading interface
- No orange buttons, no hotbar manipulation, no sidebar tabs

## Status
**CLEANUP COMPLETE** ✅ - The duplicate hook registration issue has been resolved. The module now uses only the proper class-based scene controls integration via `WFRPProperSceneControls`. Ready for testing in FoundryVTT.
