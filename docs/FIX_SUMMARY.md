# Fix Summary: Dataset Validation from Memory

## Problem
Dataset "xxxx" (and other datasets like "444") were failing validation with:
- 404 errors trying to fetch files from `/datasets/xxxx/config.json`
- Error: "Config currency.denominations must be a non-empty array"

## Root Causes
1. **ConfigValidator reading from disk**: The validator was trying to validate datasets by reading files from disk, when **all datasets are stored in `game.settings` after first launch**
2. **Migration reading wrong setting**: The currency config migration was reading from deprecated `userDatasetsData` instead of the new `datasets` setting

## Solution
Modified `scripts/config-validator.js` to:
1. Check if datasets have been initialized
2. Read ALL datasets from `game.settings.get('fvtt-trading-places', 'datasets')`
3. Validate datasets from memory instead of files
4. Skip validation on first launch (before initialization)

## Changes Made

### Modified Methods
1. **`validateRequiredConfigFiles()`** (lines 358-406)
   - Now checks `datasetsInitialized` flag
   - Reads datasets from `game.settings` instead of files
   - No more HTTP requests to `/datasets/` folder

2. **`validateDatasetStructure()`** (lines 636-698)
   - Checks `datasetsInitialized` flag
   - Loads all datasets from `game.settings.get('datasets')`
   - Uses new `validateDatasetFromMemory()` method

### New Methods
3. **`validateDatasetFromMemory()`** (lines 700-757)
   - Validates a dataset object from memory
   - Checks for required keys: config, settlements, cargoTypes
   - Validates content structure using existing validation logic

### Removed Methods
4. **`isUserDataset()`** - No longer needed
5. **`validateUserDataset()`** - Replaced by `validateDatasetFromMemory()`

## Result
✅ No more 404 errors  
✅ Datasets validated from memory (game.settings)  
✅ All datasets (file-based and user-created) treated uniformly  
✅ Actual config errors (if any) will be reported correctly  

## Testing
After reload, you should see:
- No HTTP 404 errors in console
- Dataset validation passes (or shows actual config issues, not file access issues)
- Module loads successfully
