# Trading Places Module

## Phase 1: Foundry Harness - COMPLETE âœ…

The Foundry Harness provides a lightweight testing environment that runs the module outside of Foundry VTT for automated testing and development.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run default scenarios (headless)
npm run harness

# Run with visual UI
npm run harness:ui

# Run specific scenarios
npm run harness:buying
npm run harness:availability

# Run with deterministic results (CI)
npm run harness:ci
```

### Features

- **Headless Mode**: Automated testing with mocked Foundry globals
- **Rendered Mode**: Browser-based template inspection
- **Deterministic Testing**: Seeded random generation for consistent results
- **Real Module Integration**: Loads actual module code when available
- **Scenario-Based Testing**: Extensible scenario system

See [Foundry Harness Documentation](tests/foundry-harness/README.md) for detailed usage.
