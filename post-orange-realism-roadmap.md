# Post-Orange-Realism Feature Backlog

These items are deferred to the release following the orange-realism update. Keep requirements high-level for now; revisit specs once the current milestone ships.

## Deferred Features

- **Rumor Mode Trading**
  - Cross-settlement merchant matching driven by desperation and proximity
  - Premium pricing hooks for rumor-sourced goods
  - UX flow for revealing and acting on rumors

- **Mission / Contract System**
  - Time-bound procurement contracts with risk tiers and payment rules
  - Integration with desperation and rumor pipelines for target selection
  - Failure penalties (late delivery, partial fulfillment, mission abort)

- **Fractional Trade Penalties**
  - Pricing adjustments when players buy/sell only part of a merchant’s offer
  - Bonuses for full-volume trades
  - Configurable curves for partial trade handling

## Tracking Notes

- Revisit these once the orange-realism mechanics (equilibrium, desperation rerolls, flag pipeline) are stable.
- Any data or config hooks required for these systems should be captured as TODOs in the orange-realism work so we don’t lose context.
